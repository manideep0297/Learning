Exception handling - the way to handle any interuption in the code

nullpointerException...

This is user ur passing is null please check and pass

@ExceptionHandler

@ControllerAdvice - handling exception globally

Entity - DB

DTO - Data Transfer Objects -> if you want to send specific info to user the we use dto (We can modify whatever data we need to send).

DAO - is to communicate with DB


First we create whatever the customExceptionClass u need -> is registerd in GlobalHandlerExpton annotated with @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler

If u want to send the response in specific format u can use DTO
