for handling authentication, authorization, protection (CSRF, SSRF etc)

authorization -> once he accessed the system what is his role/what he should see in system

It provides default login

SecurityFilterChain -> it checks every request coming to our application

localhost -> securityfilter it will authenticate then authorize then it will show -> show/don't show
